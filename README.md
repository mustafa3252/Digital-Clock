# Digital-Clock
A minimalist digital clock 🕐 made using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript 

Hello there! I am learing web development and as a part of my practice I made a digital clock. 🖊️
This clock uses Fonts from google's font api, also gradient for additional styling. 👨‍💻
It uses javascript to update the hours, minutes and seconds elements in the index.html document. 

Below is a screenshot of the website ⤵️
